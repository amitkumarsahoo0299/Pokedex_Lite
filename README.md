# Pokémon Web App

A simple and interactive web application to explore Pokémon data, including their types, stats, and abilities, using data from the Pokémon API. The app allows users to filter Pokémon by types (e.g., Fire, Water, Grass) and favorite specific Pokémon.

## Features

- **Pokémon List**: Display a list of Pokémon with their images, types, and names.
- **Detailed View**: On clicking a Pokémon, a detailed view with additional stats like HP, Attack, and Abilities is displayed.
- **Favorite System**: Users can mark Pokémon as favorites, with a toggle button to switch between "Favorite" and "Unfavorite".
- **Type Filtering**: Filter Pokémon by their types (Fire, Water, Grass, etc.).
- **Animations**: Subtle hover animations for interactivity and a better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We used React to create a dynamic, component-based architecture for easy scalability and reusability.
- **React Router**: For navigating between different views in the app, such as the main Pokémon list and detailed view.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: A utility-first CSS framework to style the application. Tailwind's classes provide fast and flexible styling, allowing us to implement responsive designs and animations.
- **Pokémon API**: The data is fetched from the public Pokémon API (https://pokeapi.co/), providing a rich source of Pokémon data, including types, stats, and abilities.

### Technologies and Libraries
- **React**: We chose React for its component-based architecture, making it easier to manage states and handle UI interactions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and flexible styling without writing custom CSS from scratch. It allows us to implement responsive designs with ease.
- **Pokémon API**: A reliable and free API for fetching data about Pokémon. It provides all the necessary details (name, type, stats, etc.) for each Pokémon.
- **React Router**: We used React Router for handling different routes within the app, making it easy to navigate between the Pokémon list and individual Pokémon details.
